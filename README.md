> Binary payload processor for Converting, Calibrating, and Validating dynamic sensor data.

## Why

As developers of IoT hardware we were often confronted with the high cost of data through mobile networks. As a result we started sending data as pure binary over TCP sockets. But with a vast array of different stations and protocols, you easily lose track of what this binary data represents. By creating a tool that handles sensor data in a generic, dynamic, and scalable way, this problem can be solved. Not only for us, but also for you.

## How

![Dataflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kukua/concava/master/doc/dataflow.jpg)

The dataflow is as follows:

1. Sensors gather measurements and send it to a connector (independent of the protocol).
2. The connector forwards the data in a standardized packet ([HTTP request](#user-content-http-requests)). Containing the device ID and payload in binary format.
3. ConCaVa then Converts, Calibrates, and Validates the data before forwarding it to the storage component.
4. The storage component stores the data (usually in the cloud).

The use of connectors allow sensor data, that is coming from various protocols (like TCP, LoRa, JSON, XML, MQTT, SigFox, SPUL), to be send to a central server in a standardized way. Next, ConCaVa will process the data in three steps:

1. Convert: use dynamic metadata to parse the binary payload in to usable data.  
	This metadata is determined by given device ID.
2. Calibrate: transform data to a desired format using sandboxed JavaScript function body.

	- Simple example: e.g. convert Fahrenheit to Celcius (`return (value - 32) / 1.8`)
	- Advanced example: transform non-linear measurements to linear data

3. Validate: correct invalid data (e.g. temperatures below zero Kelvin).

See the [functional & technical introduction](https://rawgit.com/kukua/concava-intro/master/index.html) for more information.

## Installation

ConCaVa can be run as a NodeJS program or in a Docker container.

### NodeJS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kukua/concava
cd concava
npm install
cp config.js.sample config.js
# > Edit config.js
npm start
# Should output "Listening on port X"
```

Tested with NodeJS v5.0 and NPM v3.3.

### Docker

First, [install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). Then run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kukua/concava/master/config.js.sample > config.js
# > Edit config.js
docker run -d -p 3000 -v $(pwd)/config.js:/data/config.js --name concava kukuadev/concava
docker logs concava
# Should output "Listening on port 3000"
```

Tested with Docker v1.8.

## Testing

First, start the ConCaVa server. Then run:

```bash
echo '000005391234' | xxd -r -p | \
	curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:3000/v1/sensorData/0000000000000001' \
	-H 'Authorization: Token abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @-
# Note: if you're using Docker, change localhost to the IP address of the container
```

## HTTP requests

ConCaVa accepts the following HTTP requests:

- `POST /v1/sensorData`
- `PUT /v1/sensorData/<deviceID>` (where `deviceID` is a lowercase 16 character hex string)

The requests are identical, except for the device ID which using a `POST` request is prepended to the binary payload.

The following headers are required:

- `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`
- `Authorization: <auth>` (e.g. `Token abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789`)

You can use one of these commands for testing:

```bash
echo '<deviceID><hex>' | xxd -r -p | \
	curl -i -XPOST 'http://<host>:3000/v1/sensorData' \
	-H 'Authorization: Token <token>' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @-

echo '<hex>' | xxd -r -p | \
	curl -i -XPUT 'http://<host>:3000/v1/sensorData/<deviceID>' \
	-H 'Authorization: Token <token>' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @-
```
