# Use cases

This chapter provides various use cases for ConCaVa.

## LoRa weather stations

The LoRa KPN server provides bloated XML, containing the payload hex and unique device ID. By using binary data, the payload size can be reduced from ~400 bytes of XML to ~40 bytes of binary data. ConCaVa helps processing this data.
